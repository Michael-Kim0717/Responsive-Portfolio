            <p> Hello, thank you for visiting my page! :) </p>
            <br>
            <p> 
                My name is Michael Kim.
                I graduated from Rutgers University in 2017 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.
                While in school, I have been studying mobile development with the intentions of becoming a software developer.
            </p> 
            <br>
            <p>
                Aside from programming, I am also a 3rd degree black belt, aspiring baker, and Sunday school teacher.
                When I was young, I always had a love for cooking (even though I knew nothing of it) and astronomy.
                As of now, my recent passion has just been seeing things come together.
                Whether it has been projects, creation of a dish, event planning coming to life, or even a simple 1000-piece puzzle set, I highly enjoyed the process.
                Just being able to see the fruits of labor come to life has been my most recent joy center.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Some of my future goals are traveling the world, becoming a good chef, and learning some acrobatics.
            </p>
